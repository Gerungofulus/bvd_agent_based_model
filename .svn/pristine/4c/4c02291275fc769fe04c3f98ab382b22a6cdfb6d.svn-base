In order for that programm to work we need the too libraries libhdf5.so and libhdf5_hl.so
They can be linked by invoking the following two commands in your command line.
Make sure that your current working directory is the one with the programm.
Also make sure that the first path behind the -s directive is the actual path to the
installed library. The path given in that example is the one on our machines. If your
configuration is different, you need to change that.


ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libhdf5_serial.so.8.0.2 libhdf5.so
ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libhdf5_serial_hl.so.8.0.2 libhdf5_hl.so

After you linked the libraries properly the program should compile by using the command

make programm
