Added new ini file parameter set for introducing custom cows to the system at any given point in time.
Included a new constructor for cows, which takes the string of a cow, which should be used for reading from the ini file to create a new cow.

Changed different parts of the trade scheduling process in Farm.cpp and System.cpp and the trade logging process in AdvancedOutput.cpp in order to comply with trades with srcFarm == NULL.

Fixed a warning for AdvancedOutput.cpp:499
Added vector of Cow trade Criteria as a priority list to the market.h
